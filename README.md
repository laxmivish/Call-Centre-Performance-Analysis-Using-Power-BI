# Call-Centre-Performance-Analysis-using-Power-BI
The project aimed to enhance customer service performance through a comprehensive analysis of key metrics. We focused on overall customer satisfaction, calls answered/abandoned, calls by time, average speed of answer, and agent performance based on average handle time (talk duration) versus calls answered.
The average speed of answer metric was crucial in measuring responsiveness. By optimizing this metric, we aimed to reduce customer wait times and enhance satisfaction levels.

The creation of the Agent's Performance Quadrant offered a visual representation of agent efficiency and effectiveness. This analysis enabled us to identify high-performing agents, optimize their workload, and provide targeted coaching for agents needing improvement.

The project outcomes provide actionable insights for improving overall customer satisfaction, optimizing call center operations, and enhancing agent performance. By leveraging these insights, we are committed to delivering exceptional customer experiences and continuously improving our service delivery.
